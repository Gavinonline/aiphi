                <h2>Service Level Agreement (SLA)</h2>
                <p>a. Availability Commitment</p>
                <p>The Company guarantees a service availability of no less than 99% for the compute resources provided under this agreement. Availability is measured on a monthly basis, excluding scheduled maintenance and events beyond the Company's reasonable control.</p>

                <p>b. Compensation for Downtime</p>
                <p>In the event of a service outage that results in availability falling below the agreed-upon threshold, the Company will compensate the Client by providing compute credits on a 1:1 basis, calculated against the duration of the outage. These credits can be applied towards future usage of the Company's services.</p>

                <p>c. Exclusions</p>
                <p>The SLA does not apply to service interruptions caused by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client's misuse or unauthorized modifications to the service.</li>
                    <li>Events outside of the Company's reasonable control, including but not limited to force majeure events.</li>
                    <li>Scheduled maintenance, provided the Client is informed at least 48 hours in advance.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>d. Claim Procedure</p>
                <p>To claim compensation, the Client must submit a formal request within 30 days of the outage, providing detailed information about the incident. The Company will review the claim and apply the compute credits, if applicable, within 15 business days.</p>

                <p>e. Limitation of Liability</p>
                <p>The compensation outlined in this SLA, specifically the provision of compute credits, is the Client's sole and exclusive remedy for service outages or failures.</p>
